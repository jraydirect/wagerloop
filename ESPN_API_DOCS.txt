5. Sport-Specific Endpoints
While many API structures are similar across sports, specific endpoints, parameters, and data availability can vary. The following sections detail endpoints discovered for major sports leagues. The general pattern often follows /{base_url}/apis/{version}/{domain}/{sport}/{league}/{resource}.[5, 2, 7, 9, 23, 16, 18] However, variations exist, such as the use of league abbreviations in soccer paths [5, 2, 9] or team abbreviations in some college sports endpoints [5, 7, 9], requiring careful attention to the specific sport being queried.

5.1. Football (NFL)
The NFL is extensively covered in the discovered API endpoints, reflecting its popularity. Data spans scores, schedules, team information, player statistics, game details, news, and draft information. Many examples across the different base URLs (site.api, sports.core.api, site.web.api, cdn.espn) relate to the NFL.[3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 23, 16]

College football shares similarities with the NFL structure but includes unique elements like rankings and conference/group filtering. Some endpoints may also accept team abbreviations instead of numerical IDs.[5, 7, 9] A notable issue was reported where the query parameter group=ID returned default results, while groups=ID worked correctly for filtering scoreboards by conference.[15]

7. Betting & Odds Endpoints
A significant number of endpoints, primarily hosted on sports.core.api.espn.com, are dedicated to betting odds and related data.[3, 4, 6, 8, 10] These endpoints provide access to win probabilities, point spreads, moneylines, futures, and historical odds data from various sportsbooks.

The level of detail available, including endpoints for specific betting providers (identified by bet_provider_id), odds movement tracking, head-to-head odds, and team performance against the spread (ATS), suggests a system designed to aggregate and display comprehensive betting information, likely reflecting the data shown on ESPN's own platforms.[3, 6] This highlights the increasing integration between sports media and the sports betting industry.

Known bet_provider_id values include: 38 (Caesars), 31 (William Hill), 41 (SugarHouse), 36 (Unibet), 2000 (Bet365), 25 (Westgate), 45 (William Hill NJ), 1001 (accuscore), 1004 (consensus), 1003 (numberfire), 1002 (teamrankings).[3, 6]
