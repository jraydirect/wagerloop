Key Characteristics of ESPN's Undocumented APIs
Unofficial and Unstable: ESPN does not provide public support or documentation for these APIs. Endpoints, parameters, and response structures can change unexpectedly, potentially breaking applications that rely on them.

Discovery through Reverse-Engineering: Most endpoints have been identified by monitoring network requests made by ESPN's own platforms (e.g., espn.com).

Multiple Base URLs: ESPN uses several API subdomains, each likely serving different types of data or backend services. Examples include site.api.espn.com (general site data), sports.core.api.espn.com (core sports data), and fantasy.espn.com (fantasy sports data).

Common Parameters and Headers:

Path Parameters: Used within the URL path to specify resources (e.g., {sport}, {league}, {team_id}, {athlete_id}, {game_id}, {year}).

Query Parameters: Appended to the URL for filtering, pagination, or modifying requests (e.g., limit, dates, season, seasontype, week, view, enable, active=true, xhr=1, query).

HTTP Headers: X-Fantasy-Filter (for complex filtering in Fantasy API) and Accept: application/json are notable. Authentication cookies (espn_s2, SWID) are required for private fantasy leagues.

Fantasy API Specifics: The Fantasy API, primarily under fantasy.espn.com, heavily uses the view query parameter and X-Fantasy-Filter header for data manipulation. It's often less intuitive due to its design for ESPN's internal application needs, leading many developers to use community-developed wrapper libraries.
