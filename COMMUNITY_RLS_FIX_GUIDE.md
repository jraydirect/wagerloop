# Community RLS Infinite Recursion Fix Guide

## Problem
The Communities feature is showing a database error: `PostgrestException(message: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'community_members', code: 42P17)`

This happens because the Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `community_members` table have circular dependencies - they try to check membership by querying the same table they're protecting.

## Solution

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Open your WagerLoop project
4. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** tab

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script
1. Copy the contents of `fix_community_rls_policies.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script

This will:
- Remove the problematic recursive policies
- Create new, non-recursive policies
- Ensure proper access control without infinite loops

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
After running the script, test the Communities feature:
1. Open the WagerLoop app
2. Navigate to the Communities page
3. The error should be gone and communities should load properly

## What Changed

### Before (Problematic)
```sql
-- This caused infinite recursion
CREATE POLICY "Community members can view other members" ON community_members
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM community_members cm  -- ðŸš« Circular reference!
      WHERE cm.community_id = community_members.community_id
    )
  );
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- These policies avoid self-referential queries
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own memberships" ON community_members
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);  -- âœ… Simple, direct check

CREATE POLICY "Public community members are viewable" ON community_members
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM communities  -- âœ… References different table
      WHERE id = community_id AND NOT is_private
    )
  );
```

## Policy Changes Summary

### New Policies for `community_members`
1. **Users can view their own memberships** - Users can see communities they've joined
2. **Public community members are viewable** - Anyone can see members of public communities  
3. **Community owners can view their members** - Creators can see all their community members

### Updated Policies for `communities`
1. **Private communities viewable by creators only** - Only creators can see their private communities

## Important Notes

- **Private community access**: With these changes, regular members cannot see private communities they've joined through RLS policies (to avoid recursion)
- **Workaround**: The app handles this through application logic - users can still join and interact with private communities
- **Performance**: These new policies are more efficient as they avoid complex recursive queries

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Clear your browser cache** and refresh the app
2. **Check the SQL Editor** for any error messages when running the script
3. **Verify table structure** - ensure the `communities` and `community_members` tables exist
4. **Check user authentication** - make sure you're logged in properly

## Technical Details

The infinite recursion occurred because:
1. User tries to query `community_members`
2. Policy checks if user is in `community_members` (same table)
3. That check triggers the same policy again
4. Creates infinite loop â†’ Database error

The fix uses simpler, direct checks that don't reference the same table being queried.
