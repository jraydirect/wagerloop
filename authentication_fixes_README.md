# WagerLoop1 Authentication Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve authentication issues in the WagerLoop1 Flutter application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Google Sign-In "Future already completed" error**
2. **Row-Level Security (RLS) policy violations for profiles table**
3. **"User not authenticated" error during onboarding completion**

## Database Changes Required

**IMPORTANT**: You must run the SQL script in your Supabase database before testing the app.

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `database_fixes.sql`
4. Execute the script

This will:
- Set up proper RLS policies for the profiles table
- Create a trigger to automatically create profiles when users sign up
- Allow users to insert, update, and view their own profiles

## Code Changes Made

### 1. AuthService Improvements

- **Google Sign-In**: Added `signOut()` before `signIn()` to prevent "Future already completed" error
- **Profile Creation**: Added error handling and delays to ensure proper session establishment
- **Debug Method**: Added `debugAuthState()` method for troubleshooting
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and logging throughout

### 2. Onboarding Page Enhancements

- **Authentication Verification**: Added checks for user and session before completing onboarding
- **Session Refresh**: Added session refresh before profile updates
- **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages with action buttons
- **Debug Integration**: Calls debug method when authentication fails

### 3. Registration Flow

- **Profile Creation**: Enhanced profile creation during signup with better error handling
- **Email Field**: Ensured email is always included in profile creation

## Testing Instructions

1. **First**: Run the database fixes SQL script in Supabase
2. **Clean Install**: Delete and reinstall the app to clear any cached auth state
3. **Test Google Sign-Up**: Try creating a new account with Google
4. **Test Email Sign-Up**: Try creating a new account with email/password
5. **Test Onboarding**: Complete the team selection and profile setup
6. **Verify**: Check that you reach the main app without errors

## Debugging

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
2. Look for "AUTH DEBUG INFO" logs that show the current authentication state
3. Verify the database policies are correctly applied in Supabase
4. Ensure your app has the latest code changes

## Key Files Modified

- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Main authentication logic
- `lib/pages/auth/onboarding_page.dart` - Onboarding completion flow
- `lib/pages/auth/register_page.dart` - Registration improvements
- `database_fixes.sql` - Database schema and policies

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes:

1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Monitor the console logs for any remaining issues
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling as needed
4. Update your RLS policies if you add new features that require different permissions

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "User not authenticated" during onboarding
- Ensure the database trigger is working properly
- Check that RLS policies allow profile creation
- Verify the session hasn't expired

### Google Sign-In still failing
- Clear app data and try again
- Check that Google OAuth credentials are correct
- Verify network connectivity

### Profile creation errors
- Check database logs in Supabase
- Ensure the profiles table structure matches the code
- Verify RLS policies are not too restrictive
