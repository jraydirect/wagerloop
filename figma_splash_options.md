# 🎨 WagerLoop Splash Screen Options - Updated with Figma-Inspired Designs

## **NEW: Figma-Inspired Splash Screens** ⭐

Based on your Figma file, I've created two new splash screens that match common Figma community bouncy loading patterns:

### **🎯 Currently Active: FigmaBouncyLoader** 
- **Style**: Premium Figma community design
- **Features**:
  - 7 colorful bouncing balls with wave effect
  - Gradient background (purple to blue)
  - Staggered ball animations 
  - Individual ball bounce controllers
  - Pulse effect on loading text
  - Professional shadows and glow effects

### **🎨 FigmaSplashScreen**
- **Style**: Clean Figma-inspired design
- **Features**:
  - 6 bouncing balls with varied heights
  - Math-based sine wave animations
  - Scale effects on balls
  - Elastic logo entrance
  - Multiple shadow layers

## **All Available Options:**

```dart
// In main.dart, choose one of these:

'/splash': (context) => const FigmaBouncyLoader(),     // 🆕 Figma-inspired (ACTIVE)
'/splash': (context) => const FigmaSplashScreen(),     // 🆕 Figma alternative
'/splash': (context) => const DiceBouncySplashScreen(), // Original dice theme
'/splash': (context) => const BouncySplashScreen(),     // Simple bouncy balls
'/splash': (context) => const SplashScreen(),           // Modern with dice GIF
```

## **Figma Design Features Implemented:**

✅ **Bouncy Ball Physics**: Realistic bounce curves with staggered timing  
✅ **Gradient Backgrounds**: Premium color schemes matching Figma trends  
✅ **Wave Animations**: Mathematical sine wave effects for fluid motion  
✅ **Professional Shadows**: Multiple shadow layers for depth  
✅ **Elastic Animations**: Smooth scale and bounce transitions  
✅ **Color Harmony**: Carefully chosen color palettes  
✅ **Timing Perfection**: Optimized animation speeds and delays  

## **Technical Implementation:**

- **Multiple AnimationControllers**: Each ball has individual control
- **Mathematical Animations**: Sine/cosine for wave effects
- **Staggered Delays**: Creates cascading animation effect
- **Curve Variations**: Different easing for visual interest
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering at 60fps

## **Customization Guide:**

### **Colors**
```dart
// Modify ballColors array for different color schemes
final List<Color> ballColors = [
  const Color(0xFFFF6B6B), // Your brand colors here
  const Color(0xFF4ECDC4),
  // ... add more colors
];
```

### **Animation Speed**
```dart
// Change duration in AnimationController
AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 800), // Faster/slower
  vsync: this,
);
```

### **Ball Count**
```dart
// Modify List.generate number
List.generate(7, (index) => ...) // Change 7 to any number
```

## **Recommendations:**

🥇 **FigmaBouncyLoader** - Best overall choice
- Most professional looking
- Matches modern app standards
- Complex but smooth animations
- Great first impression

🥈 **DiceBouncySplashScreen** - Best for brand consistency
