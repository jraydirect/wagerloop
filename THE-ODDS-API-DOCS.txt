#More info
The list of events returned in the /odds endpoint mirrors events that are listed by major bookmakers. This usually includes games for the current round
Events may temporarily become unavailable after a round, before bookmakers begin listing the next round of games
Events may be unavailable if the sport is not in season. For popular sports, bookmakers may begin listing new season events a few months in advance
If no events are returned, the request will not count against the usage quota
To determine if an event is in-play, the commence_time can be used. If commence_time is less than the current time, the event is in-play. The /odds endpoint does not return completed events


#GET scores
Returns a list of upcoming, live and recently completed games for a given sport. Live and recently completed games contain scores. Games from up to 3 days ago can be returned using the daysFrom parameter. Live scores update approximately every 30 seconds.

The scores endpoint applies to selected sports and is gradually being expanded to more sports. See the current list of covered sports and leagues.


#Endpoint
GET /v4/sports/{sport}/scores/?apiKey={apiKey}&daysFrom={daysFrom}&dateFormat={dateFormat}

#Parameters
sport   The sport key obtained from calling the /sports endpoint.

apiKey   The API key associated with your subscription. See usage plans

daysFrom   Optional - The number of days in the past from which to return completed games. Valid values are integers from 1 to 3. If this parameter is missing, only live and upcoming games are returned.

dateFormat   Optional - Determines the format of timestamps in the response. Valid values are unix and iso (ISO 8601). Defaults to iso.

eventIds   Optional - Comma-separated game ids. Filters the response to only return games for the specified game ids.

#Response Headers
The following response headers are returned

x-requests-remaining   The usage credits remaining until the quota resets
x-requests-used   The usage credits used since the last quota reset
x-requests-last   The usage cost of the last API call
#Usage Quota Costs
This endpoint does not count against the usage quota.


#GET event odds
Returns odds for a single event. Accepts any available betting markets using the markets parameter. Coverage of non-featured markets is currently limited to selected bookmakers and sports, and expanding over time.

When to use this endpoint: Use this endpoint to access odds for any supported market. Since the volume of data returned can be large, these requests will only query one event at a time. If you are only interested in the most popular betting markets, including head-to-head (moneyline), point spreads (handicap), over/under (totals), the main /odds endpoint is simpler to integrate and more cost-effective.

#Endpoint
GET /v4/sports/{sport}/events/{eventId}/odds?apiKey={apiKey}&regions={regions}&markets={markets}&dateFormat={dateFormat}&oddsFormat={oddsFormat}

#Parameters
Parameters are the same as for the /odds endpoint with the addition of the eventId in the path. All available market keys are accepted in the markets parameter.

eventId   The id of an upcoming or live game. Event ids can be found in the "id" field in the response of the events endpoint.
#Schema
For the detailed API spec, see the Swagger API docs(opens new window)

#Example Request
GET https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports/americanfootball_nfl/events/a512a48a58c4329048174217b2cc7ce0/odds?apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY&regions=us&markets=player_pass_tds&oddsFormat=american(opens new window)

#Example Response
The response schema is almost the same as that of the /odds endpoint with a few differces:

A single game is returned, determined by the eventId parameter.
The last_update field is only available on the market level in the response and not on the bookmaker level. This reflects the fact that markets can update on their own schedule.
Relevant markets will have a description field in their outcomes.

x-requests-remaining   The usage credits remaining until the quota resets
x-requests-used   The usage credits used since the last quota reset
x-requests-last   The usage cost of the last API call
#Usage Quota Costs

Examples of usage quota costs

1 market, 1 region
Cost: 1
Example /v4/sports/americanfootball_nfl/events/a512a48a58c4329048174217b2cc7ce0/odds?markets=h2h&regions=us&...

3 markets, 1 region
Cost: 3
Example /v4/sports/americanfootball_nfl/events/a512a48a58c4329048174217b2cc7ce0/odds?markets=h2h,spreads,totals&regions=us&...

1 market, 3 regions
Cost: 3
Example /v4/sports/soccer_epl/events/037d7b6bb128546961e2a06680f63944/odds?markets=h2h&regions=us,uk,eu&...

3 markets, 3 regions
Cost: 9
Example: /v4/sports/basketball_nba/events/0b83beff5f82f8623eea93dbc1d7cd4e/odds?markets=h2h,spreads,totals&regions=us,uk,au&...


Keeping track of quota usage

To keep track of usage credits, every API response includes the following response headers:

x-requests-remaining   The usage credits remaining until the quota resets
x-requests-used   The usage credits used since the last quota reset
x-requests-last   The usage cost of the last API call
#More info
Responses with empty data do not count towards the usage quota.
When calculating the market component of usage quota costs, a count of unique markets in the API response is used. For example if you specify 5 different markets and 1 region in the API call, and data is only available for 2 markets, the cost will be [2 markets] x [1 region] = 2


#GET participants
Returns list of participants for a given sport. Depending on the sport, a participant can be either a team or an individual. For example for NBA, a list of teams is returned. For tennis, a list of players is returned.

This endpoint does not return players on a team.

The returned list should be treated as a whitelist and may include participants that are not currently active.

#More info
Responses with empty data do not count towards the usage quota.
Prior to Septemer 18th 2022, only decimal odds were caputred in historical snapshots. American odds before this time are calculated from decimal odds and may include small rounding errors.
Data errors aren't common but they can occur from time to time. We are usually quick to correct errors in the current odds API, however they can still be present in historical odds snapshots. In future we plan to remove known errors from historical snapshots.
Bookmakers, sports and markets will only be available in the historical odds API from the time that they were added to the current odds API.

x-requests-remaining   The usage credits remaining until the quota resets
x-requests-used   The usage credits used since the last quota reset
x-requests-last   The usage cost of the last API call
#Usage Quota Costs
This endpoint costs 1 from usage quota. If no events are found, it will not cost.


#GET historical event odds
Returns historical odds for a single event as they appeared at a specified timestamp. Accepts any available betting markets using the markets parameter. Historical data for additional markets (player props, alternate lines, period markets) are available after 2023-05-03T05:30:00Z. This endpoint is only available on paid usage plans.

Tip

When querying historical odds for featured markets, the historical odds endpoint is simpler to implement and more cost-effective.

#Endpoint
GET /v4/historical/sports/{sport}/events/{eventId}/odds?apiKey={apiKey}&regions={regions}&markets={markets}&dateFormat={dateFormat}&oddsFormat={oddsFormat}&date={date}

#Parameters
Parameters are the same as for the /odds endpoint with the additions of the eventId in the path, and the date query parameter. All available market keys are accepted in the markets parameter.

eventId   The id of a historical game. Historical event ids can be found in the "id" field in the response of the historical events endpoint.

date   The timestamp of the data snapshot to be returned, specified in ISO8601 format, for example 2023-11-29T22:42:00Z The historical odds API will return the closest snapshot equal to or earlier than the provided date parameter. Historical data for additional markets are available after 2023-05-03T05:30:00Z. Snapshots are available at 5 minute intervals.

#Response Headers
The following response headers are returned

x-requests-remaining   The usage credits remaining until the quota resets
x-requests-used   The usage credits used since the last quota reset
x-requests-last   The usage cost of the last API call
#Usage Quota Costs
The usage quota cost depends on the number of markets and regions used in the request.

cost = 10 x [number of unique markets returned] x [number of regions specified]

Examples of usage quota costs

1 market, 1 region
Cost: 10
Example /v4/historical/sports/americanfootball_nfl/events/a512a48a58c4329048174217b2cc7ce0/odds?markets=player_pass_tds&regions=us&...

3 markets, 1 region
Cost: 30
Example /v4/historical/sports/americanfootball_nfl/events/a512a48a58c4329048174217b2cc7ce0/odds?markets=player_pass_tds,player_anytime_td,player_rush_longest&regions=us&...

1 market, 3 regions
Cost: 30
Example /v4/historical/sports/basketball_nba/events/037d7b6bb128546961e2a06680f63944/odds?markets=player_points&regions=us,us2,au&...

3 markets, 3 regions
Cost: 90
Example: /v4/historical/sports/basketball_nba/events/0b83beff5f82f8623eea93dbc1d7cd4e/odds?markets=player_points,player_assists,alternate_spreads&regions=us,us2,au&...


Keeping track of quota usage

To keep track of usage credits, every API response includes the following response headers:

x-requests-used
x-requests-remaining
x-requests-last
#More info
Responses with empty data do not count towards the usage quota.
When calculating the market component of usage quota costs, a count of unique markets in the API response is used. For example if you specify 5 different markets and 1 region in the API call, and data is only available for 2 markets, the cost will be 10 x [2 markets] x [1 region] = 20


#Rate Limiting (status code 429)
Requests are rate limited in order to protect our systems from sudden bursts in traffic. If you enounter the rate limit, the API will respond with a status code of 429, in which case try spacing out requests over several seconds. More information can be found here.
